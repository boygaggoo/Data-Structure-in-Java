* Five Algorithm Approaches

Approach 1: Examplify
	* Description: Write out specific examples of the problem, and see if you can figure out a general rule.

Approach 2: Pattern Matching
	* Description: Consider what problems the algorithm is similar to, and figure out if you can modify the solution to develop   an algorithm for this problem.

Approach 3: Simplify and Generalize
	* Description: Change constraint to simplyfy the problem. then try to solve it. Once you have the algorithm for the simplified problem, generalize the problem.

Approach 4: Base Case and Build
	* Description: Solve the algorithm for a base case. Then try to solve it for elements one and two, assuming that you have the answer for element one. Then try to solve it for elements one, two and three, assuming that you have the answer to elements one and two.
